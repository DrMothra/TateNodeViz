The director Pontus Hultén accepted, provided that Nielsen assumed full economic and organisational responsibility for the project. In October 1968, Modellen – En model förettkvalitativtsamhälle (The Model – A Model for a Qualitative Society) opened and offered free access for all of Stockholm’s children, attracting more than 33,500 visitors, 20,000 of whom were children. New walls and a Masonite Goor were installed in the large hall, along with jungle gyms, a foamrubber basin, swings, climbing ropes and water chutes. Tools, paint, building materials and fabrics were at the children’s disposal during the entire course of the project to aid their creativity. The Royal Theatre donated a selection of period costumes to be used for dressing up, while Nielsen provided carnival masks of Charles de Gaulle, Mao Zedong, Lyndon B. Johnson and Fidel Castro. Loudspeakers were placed in each corner of the exhibition space, and the children operated turntables with a collection of LPs from every genre. In the restaurant, a number of TV screens carried live transmissions from the galleries, enabling visitors to take in the whole experience from outside. The white cube, a space designed for contemplation, was thus transformed into an open area for play and social irrationality, offering new possibilities for behaviour and proving that activity could not be prescribed.",http://www.macba.cat/uploads/20120210/3566_770x510.jpg,,"Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden",Sweden,"59.3260466,18.0824992",All,Children,"33,500 visitors, 20,000 of whom were children",Object interaction,,,Palle Nielsen,,,,Pontus Hultén,,Moderna Museet Stockholm

In the Octagon of the Duveen Galleries, in what is now Tate Britain, Beuys lectured on humanity’s natural creative capacity and the power of direct democracy to shape society. He chalked his conceptual theories onto three blackboards (now in the Tate collection) and engaged the crowd in a free-form and often tense discussion. Not simply receptacles of ideas, the blackboards helped to determine the relationship between the artist and his audience, clearly signalling Beuys’s role as instructor.

In each work a photograph documenting the event is hugely enlarged, before being somehow obscured, by a sheet for example, a curtain, or a screen of wooden boards. In this case Metzger has used a press photograph taken shortly after Austria’s annexation to Nazi Germany in March 1938, that depicts Jewish men, women and children being forced to wash the streets of Vienna as their fellow citizens look on. The photograph has been enlarged to over thirteen square metres – rendering the figures larger than life-size – and is displayed on the floor, covered with a cotton sheet. In order to see it, the viewer is required to crawl on their hands and knees beneath the sheet, mimicking the actions of the Jewish subjects, while the size and proximity of the image makes it impossible to apprehend as a whole. Metzger has explained that these works seek to provoke a re-evaluation of well-worn media imagery by physically preventing the viewer from considering the photograph passively, even forcing them to share the sense of physical aggression perpetrated against its subjects.

The resulting participatory performance, The Crystal Quilt, included mass action, spoken word and sound, and was broadcast live on television and attended by over 3,000 people. Participants all wore black, and engaged in simple actions using their hands, manipulating tablecloths to create a ‘quilt’ pattern that created a large-scale spectacle of participation. The soundtrack to these movements included the women’s own voices, mixing personal observations and reminiscences with social analysis about the unused potential of the elderly. The event was the culmination of the Whisper Minnesota Project, a three-year public artwork empowering and giving a voice to older women. Suzanne Lacy was interested in enabling self-organising groups, and worked with selected women participants who were trained as ‘leaders’ and coordinated sub-groups of participants on the day.

Realised in the busy Avenue 9th of July in Minujín’s native Buenos Aires, The Parthenon of Books was fifteen metres across, thirty metres long and twelve metres high, covered in more than 20,000 books. Minujín chose books which had been banned during the Argentinian military dictatorship (1976–83), including works by Sigmund Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway and Jorge Luis Borges, as well as reference volumes and children’s stories. The books were donated by publishing houses, which had been keeping many of them in storage. Minujín’s replica of the major icon of the democratic Athenian polis became a national symbol of the restoration of democracy in Argentina. Rather than a conventional monument, however, her project was conceived as a temporary intervention, to be eventually dismantled, and as a participatory work in a public space. On 24 December 1983, the structure was leant over to one side, allowing the public to remove the books. Around 12,000 volumes were distributed among those present, while the remaining 8,000 or so were later sent to public libraries.

The Guerrilla Girls undermine the idea of a mainstream narrative by revealing the understory, the subtext, the overlooked, and the downright unfair.

Each seed had been individually sculpted and painted by specialists working in small-scale workshops in the Chinese city of Jingdezhen, especially employed by Ai for this project. Far from being industrially produced, they are the effort of hundreds of skilled hands, remunerated by the artist with a pay commensurate to their unique and time-consuming expertise. Poured into the interior of the Turbine Hall’s vast industrial space, the 100 million seeds formed a seemingly infinite landscape. Originally visitors were allowed to walk across the sculpture, but it was soon discovered that this could generate dust which could be damaging to health following sustained inhalation. As a consequence Tate, in consultation with the artist, decided to close off the area and kept the installation as an object for contemplation at a distance.

It was commissioned as part of a project entitled ‘What Are They Doing Here?’ that was run by the Siemens Art Program from 2000 to 2006 and involved Chinese artists undertaking six-month-long residencies at industrial facilities across the country. Cao Fei began her residency at OSRAM by sending a questionnaire to its employees that featured fifty questions, including ‘How do you feel about the factory?’, ‘Why did you decide to leave your home and go to the river delta?’ and ‘What do you hope to achieve in the future?’. The artist then invited fifty-five of her respondents to plan and participate in workshops in which they made installations and carried out performances, which she then filmed. The result is a twenty-minute video in three parts: the first, titled ‘Imagination of Product’, begins with a series of close-ups showing light bulb components being produced and assembled by automated machines, followed by scenes of people performing fast, repetitive tasks at their workstations. The second part, ‘Factory Fairytale’, shows individuals dancing and playing electric guitars inside the factory, often with staff working around them. The third part – ‘My Future is Not a Dream’ – shows individuals inside the factory, standing or sitting completely still and facing the camera, and in many of these scenes the operations of the factory continue around them. The film finishes with shots of people wearing white t-shirts bearing Cantonese characters that collectively spell out the phrase ‘My Future is Not a Dream’. Cao Fei has also suggested that Whose Utopia? was designed to encourage the OSRAM labourers to think about how they might work in a way that is more creative or fulfilling, stating in 2007 that "What this project does is release the workers from a standardised notion of productivity. What we are doing is production, but a type of production that connects back to the personal. I am like a social worker.

For Deller, the specific historical event that unfolded at Orgreave stands as a symbol of the destruction of mining communities as well as the wider social fabric of the working class during the Thatcher government. Deller’s use of re-enactment societies and his subversion of their usual relationship to history are an important aspect of the subject and meaning of The Battle of Orgreave. For this work, as with most of his projects, Deller interacted and engaged with different social groups or communities to produce an artwork that can take many forms. Deller also created an installation, featuring an archive of research materials, documentation and objects put together by the artist with the title The Battle of Orgreave Archive (An Injury to One is an Injury to All). The installation, which also includes Mike Figgis’s documentary film of the re-enactment, is in Tate's collection.",https://photoworks.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Deller-image.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ncrWxnxLjg,"Orgreave, South Yorkshire, UK",UK,"53.377725,-1.372188",All,Shared background,,Devised,Local community,,Jeremy Deller,,,,,,

Established by the artist Issa Samb, the filmmaker Djibril Diop Mambéty painter El Hadji Sy and the playwright Youssoupha Dione, Laboratoire Agit’Art were an interdisciplinary collective, devising street performances, improvisational happenings, installations and workshops. Although diverse in their practice, they were united in critiquing and challenging the prevailing négritude philosophy in Senegal. Their outlook was political, and community focused, publishing manifestos and creating installations out of street detritus that raised issues about African contemporary society. Today Laboratoire Agit’Art are considered to be one of the most influential African art collectives of the twentieth century.

VR,Information,Information,Exhibitions,02/07/1970,20/09/1970,"An exhibition curated by Kynaston McShine and held at MoMA in New York between 2 July and 20 September 1970. The exhibition presented videos and installations by 100 international (e.g. Vito Acconci, Art & Language, Daniel Buren, Cildo Meireles, Hans Haacke, Dennis Oppenheim, OHO Group, Adrian Piper, Grupo Frontera). It included an early example of dealing with publicly accessible archives within the context of an exhibition and some of the participating artists confronted the issues of political and media based contents. 'With an artworld that knows more readily about current work, through reproductions and the wide dissemination of information via periodicals, and that has been altered by television, films and satellites, as well as the 'jet', it is now possible for artists to be truly international; exchange with their peers is now comparatively simple. The art historian’s problem of who did what first is almost getting to the point of having to date by the hour. Increasingly artists use mail, telegrams, telex machines, etc., for transmission of works themselves—photographs, films, documents—or of information about their activity. For both artists and their public it is a stimulating and open situation, and certainly less parochial than even five years ago. It is no longer imperative for an artist to be in Paris or New York. Those far from the 'art centers' contribute more easily, without the often artificial protocol that at one time seemed essential for recognition.'

VR,"Cildo Meireles, Insertions into Ideological Circuits: Coca-Cola Project and Banknote Project","Meireles, Insertions into Ideological Circuits",Other artwork,1970,,"Meireles conceived his two Insertions into Ideological Circuits projects for an exhibition of conceptual art held at The Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1970 entitled Information. The Coca-Cola Project and the Cédula or Banknote Project explore the notion of circulation and exchange of goods, wealth and information as manifestations of the dominant ideology. For the Coca-Cola Project Meireles removed Coca-Cola bottles from normal circulation and modified them by adding critical political statements, or instructions for turning the bottle into a Molotov cocktail, before returning them to the circuit of exchange. On the bottles, such messages as ‘Yankees Go Home’ are followed by the work’s title and the artist’s statement of purpose: ‘To register informations and critical opinions on bottles and return them to circulation’. The Coca-Cola bottle is an everyday object of mass circulation; in 1970 in Brazil it was a symbol of US imperialism and it has become, globally, a symbol of capitalist consumerism. As the bottle progressively empties of dark brown liquid, the statement printed in white letters on a transparent label adhering to its side becomes increasingly invisible, only to reappear when the bottle is refilled for recirculation. The Banknote Project followed a similar structure, with texts containing information and critical messages being stamped onto banknotes that were then returned to circulation. In both projects, the messages are in a mixture of English and Portuguese. In 1970, when Meireles produced the Insertions into Ideological Circuits projects, Brazil was undergoing the most oppressive period of its twenty-one year government by military dictatorship. At the time, the Insertions constituted a form of guerrilla tactics of political resistance in order to elude the strict state censorship enforced by the regime. Meireles has commented: 'The Insertions into Ideological Circuits arose out of the need to create a system for the circulation and exchange of information that did not depend on any kind of centralized control. This would be a form of language, a system essentially opposed to the media of press, radio and television – typical examples of media that actually reach an enormous audience, but in the circulation systems of which there is always a degree of control and channelling of the information inserted ... The way I conceived it, the Insertions would only exist to the extent that they ceased to be the work of just one person. The work only exists to the extent that other people participate in it. What also arises is the need for anonymity. By extension, the question of anonymity involves the question of ownership. When the object of art becomes a practice, it becomes something over which you can have no control or ownership.'",http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T12/T12328_10.jpg,,"Brazil, ",Brazil ,"-22.9103552,-43.728535",,,,Object interaction,,Indefinite,Cildo Meireles,,,,Kynaston McShine,,Information

Women over the age of 60, who had links to activism and activist activities in the UK and beyond, were invited to share their experiences, to create timelines of significant personal and political historical events, and to answer broader questions about their position in contemporary society. These then became the basis for a one-day public performance in the Tanks at Tate Modern, where over three hundred women came together to expand and share these conversations. Some stories were dictated and projected onto the walls of the Tank, in other cases members of the public could listen to the women discussing, and a number of conversations were filmed.

VR,"Margaret Harrison, Kay Hunt and Mary Kelly, Women and Work: A Document on the Division of Labour in Industry 1973-75",Women and Work,Other artwork,1973,1975,"Between 1973 and 1975 artists Margaret Harrison, Kay Hunt and Mary Kelly conducted a detailed study of women's work in a metal box factory in Bermondsey. Their investigation was timed to coincide with the implementation of the Equal Pay Act (EPA), which had been passed in 1970. They drew together their findings to create an installation that was first displayed at the South London Art Gallery (now the South London Gallery) in 1975. Women and Work: A Document on the Division of Labour in Industry 1973-75 tells the stories of over 150 working women who participated in the project and offers a specific account of the participants' relationship to the workplace, as well as a more general examination of the changes in labour and industry brought about by the EPA. Harrison, Hunt and Kelly employed a sociological approach, collecting a vast amount of data through interviews, archival research and observation. Punch cards and rates of pay record the gap in wages between men and women, and films of life in the factory show women confined to repetitive, stationary and low-skilled tasks while men perform more physical and supervisory roles. The portraits and names of the female employees that are installed near the beginning of the display put human faces to the facts and figures. Women and Work was one of the earliest projects to tackle political and industrial issues from an overtly feminist perspective. The significance of the artists' intervention was recognized by factory management when they eventually banned Harrison, Hunt and Kelly from the site.",http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T07/T07797_9.jpg,,"Riley Road, London, UK ",UK ,"51.498614,-0.0779119",Gender identity,Profession,150,Discursive,,3 years,"Margaret Harrison, Kay Hunt, Mary Kelly",,,,,,"South London Gallery, Tate Britain, Tate Modern"

The intention was that, by sharing skills, artists would play a more active and influential role in society. In 1975-76 Latham undertook a placement with the Scottish Development Office. He was invited to come up with a plan for dealing with ‘bings’ or huge heaps of coal waste. Recognising that the bings had an ‘immaculate and classical nature’, Latham recommended they be preserved as monuments, thus eliminating the need for their costly removal.",http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T02/T02071_9.jpg,,"Midlothian and West Lothian, Scotland, UK ",UK ,"55.858849,-3.5882777",,,,Mixed,,5 months,,,,,Artist Placement Group,,
VR,Artist Placement Group,Artist Placement Group,Initiatives,1966,1982,"The Artist Placement Group (APG) emerged in London in the 1960s. The organisation actively sought to reposition the role of the artist within a wider social context, including government and commerce, while at the same time playing an important part in the history of conceptual art during the 1960s and 1970s. The idea of Artist Placement stemmed from a group of UK artists, and was guided by John Latham and initiated by Barbara Steveni, who were experimenting with radical new forms of art. Directed by Steveni, the APG pioneered the concept of art in the social context. From the outset their notion of ‘placement’ acknowledged the marginalised position of the artist and sought to improve the situation. By enabling artists to engage actively in non-art environments, the APG shifted the function of art towards ‘decision-making’. Acting outside the conventional art gallery system, the APG attempted, through negotiation and agreement, to place artists within industry and government departments. The artist would become involved in the day-to-day work of the organisation and be paid a salary equal to that of other employees by the host organization, while being given the new role of maintaining sufficient autonomy to acting on an open brief. These placements resulted in a variety of artists’ reports, films, photographs, interviews, poetry and art installations. Artists of international repute, such as Keith Arnatt, Ian Breakwell, Stuart Brisley, George Levantis and David Hall, had important placements or early associations with the APG.",http://www2.tate.org.uk/artistplacementgroup/images/homepageimg.jpg,,UK,UK ,"51.5287352,-0.3817857",All,Profession,,Mixed,,,,,,,"John Latham, Stuart Brisley, Barbara Steveni",,

Brisley had worked during this year on an Artist Placement Group project in Peterlee in a community of miners and the title is indicative of his sympathy with the miners, and the lowness (and implied loneliness) of their working conditions. The work that preceded it had a similar preoccupation with digging and working in appalling conditions. In Bregenz he was presented with a strikingly different environment: a picturesque town by the side of a lake (Lake Constance) with a small mountain behind. This work is a response to this setting, the movement from mountain to flat ground and the lake (from the vertical to the horizontal). He chose to work on a quayside, using five roughly constructed frames which marked the limits of his physical reach. The materials which he employed were water, chalk, powder (flour) and paint (black and white). He made five separate statements using each of the materials, working in all for four days. In order to reduce the drama of the work (a character that Brisley abhors) the fifth frame was a mixture of black and white. On the last day the audience was large and Brisley avoided a climax to the work by jumping into the lake and swimming, replicating his drawing action in water, another medium.",http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03315_9.jpg,,"Bregenz, Austria",Austria ,"47.4684475,9.6498534",,,,Object interaction,,,,,,,Artist Placement Group,,

VR,"Stephen Willats, Living with Practical Realities","Willats, Living with Practical Realities",Other artwork,1977,,"Living with Practical Realities’ is the first work in which, as the title implies, Willats used the real environment of his subject rather than enacting or reconstructing events for the photographs in the work. He had been concerned for several years with the ways in which people construct their own worlds in relation to the social or physical constraints put upon them. In this work he was anxious to investigate the way in which buildings represent, or are symbols for, the culture we live in. The tower block seemed an obvious candidate for study. Willats, who was brought up in West London, chose Skeffington Court in Hayes because it was a model development in the local authority's eyes and had been opened by Harold Wilson in a spirit of confidence about this form of housing. It was also close to a high density low-rise development with which he hoped to make comparisons. He began by photographing the outside of the block and through this introduced himself to several of the tenants. (He used this material for another work ‘Vertical Living’ concurrent with ‘Living with Practical Realities’). The theme that Willats had in mind was the discovery and portrayal of the isolation of people within the tower block. He was introduced to Mrs Moran, who lived alone, and who was, in addition, elderly and thus further disadvantaged in relation to the society around her. Willats explained his work to her and began a collaboration which involved him photographing the flat and her, and tape recording interviews: this process continued for six months.",http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T03/T03296_9.jpg,,"Skeffington Court, Hayes, London, UK ",UK ,"51.5047393,-0.4198262",Gender identity,Elderly,1,Discursive,,6 months,,,,,,,

In a discussion of the work, Fletcher acknowledged that it fit in with his preferred method of creating works, in which he creates the framework and structure of the work, and organises it, and then invites local participants to fulfill its potential. In this case, Fletcher selected a single busker, Stanley Prospere, who performed for the duration of the 'Performance Room', and took part in the customary post-performance interview with Fletcher and curator Catherine Wood. Prospere was paid for his time participating in the work, and his music was encountered by a significant digital audience through the live streamed element.  ",,,"Tate Modern, London, UK ",UK ,"51.5075953,-0.1015458",All,Profession,1,Generative,Mixed,,Harrell Fletcher,,,,,,
